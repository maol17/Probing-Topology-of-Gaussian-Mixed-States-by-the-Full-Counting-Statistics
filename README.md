# Probing-Topology-of-Gaussian-Mixed-States-by-the-Full-Counting-Statistics
This repository contains codes used in **Probing Topology of Gaussian Mixed States by the Full Counting Statistics**.
Draft is being prepared.

`Hamiltonian.jl` contains the model Hamiltonians used in the paper: SSH model and Haldane model.

`generating_function.jl` contains codes to compute FCS generating functions given modular Hamiltonian.
